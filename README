Application domain: 
People who enjoy movies and want to connect to others with similar movie interests.
 
Usefulness:

1) Makes entertainment more easily accesible.

2) Save time, rather than asking all your friends what they enjoy in movies.

3) Helps users discover new movies they may be interested in.

Flixter is similar to our design, however our concept is much more social media-oriented, and ours will suggest movies.

Realness:
The data is the movie information, along with the user information and reviews.  We will get the movie information from IMDB, and the user information directly from the user.

Description of functionality:
1. Basic:

Insert/update/delete records to the database:

We will insert the searched IMDB information into our database, along with user data/connections and user reviews; if there is some change, like a user's friend's name, we will be able to update it; we will delete friend connections when users unfriend each other, and remove movies from a user's likes, along with user's accounts all together if the user decides to remove him/herself from our database.

Search the database and list or print returned results:

We will support key word searching. For example, a user can search a particular keyword in a review for a movie they may like.

2. Advanced:

Suggest friends based on a user's movie interests.

Suggest movies based on a user's movie interests.

Search for a certain genre, and list users who enjoy that particular genre.
